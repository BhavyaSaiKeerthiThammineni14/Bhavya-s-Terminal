## Bhavya Sai Keerthi Thammineni's Terminal Portfolio 

This repository holds the source code for my interactive terminal-based portfolio website. 

**What is it?**

This is a unique portfolio website that utilizes a command-line interface (CLI) for navigation.  Instead of traditional menus and buttons, users can explore different sections of my portfolio by typing commands.

**Features:**

* **Interactive Commands:**  Navigate through sections like "About Me," "Social," using intuitive commands.
* **Customization:** The code allows for easy customization of the user interface and content. 
* **Lightweight:** Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for a fast and responsive experience.
